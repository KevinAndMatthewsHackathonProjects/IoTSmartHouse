### Inspiration

After observing my senile grandma's difficulty with controlling lights and other electronics around the house, we decided to create an application that could utilize new technologies such as the Internet of Things and Machine Learning to assist people with these kinds of tasks.

### What it does

The user has the ability to control a certain electronic in their home, such as a light or a fan, from their mobile device, using the Internet of Things. The electronic would power on or off, depending on its current state. The user has complete wireless control over the electronics in their home. Based on the user's daily patterns, the application utilizes Machine Learning to automatically and remotely control the electronics.

### How it works

We wired Arduino to create a controllable button and light breadboard. We programmed the breadboard to connect to PubNub and an android mobile device. This was programmed in both java, and Arduino. We then used machine learning to learn and recognize patterns over time.
#### Roles
